# Models_mortgage

This is a courserwork project at University of Leicester to construct a mortgage calculator using Markov Chain models. The assignment can be found in file: "Project2015_MA7404". 

The app is hosted by shinyapps.io @ http://jansila.shinyapps.io/Models_final 

The documentation is uploaded as well as project_documentation.pdf and it contains all the necessary information including academic references etc. 
I also created another repository that contains my own implementation for statistical test if a series possesses Markov property. 

My code uses package markovchain by Giorgio Spedicato to estimate the transition probabilities. https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/markovchain/index.html

Other than that, it is all originial work. 

I also included the dataset in "import.xlsx"
